      The ros2_control hardware interface for motor with encoder using Adafruit DC motor Hat.
      MoRVE is using a system hardware interface-type. It uses effort command as (pwm) and velocity state interface.
      This hardware interface gives opportunity to make robot with two or four wheels.
      It is possible to use Differential drive controller or Omnidirectional conntroller.
      Each wheel needs to be first connected to PID controller via ros2_control framework.
