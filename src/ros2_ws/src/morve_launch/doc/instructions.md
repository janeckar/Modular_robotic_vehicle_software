## Testing setup of the one robot wheel
1. on the Raspberry Pi start with use of the morve_launch package executable morve.launch.py it start's robot hardware interface and loads pid controller
2. start plotjuggler, ros2 run plotjuggler plotjuggler, and use introspection data values
3. the gains of the pid controller can be changed at runtime with use of
```
ros2 param set /pwm_pid_controller gains.front_left_wheel_joint.i 1.0

``` 
4. listening for changes on the controller can be monitored on topic /pwm_pid_controller/controller_state
```
ros2 topic echo /pwm_pid_controller/controller_state

```
5. basic command can be published to topic /pwm_pid_controller/reference
```
ros2 topic pub /pwm_pid_controller/reference control_msgs/msg/MultiDOFCommand "{dof_names: {'front_left_wheel_joint'}, values: {0.2}}"
```
